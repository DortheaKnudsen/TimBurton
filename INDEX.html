                <italic>Tim Burton</italic> or Timothy Walter Burton was born in Burbank, California, to
                Jean Rae (Erickson), who owned a cat-themed gift shop,
                and William Reed Burton, who worked for the Burbank Park and Recreation Department.
                He spent most of his childhood as a recluse, drawing cartoons, and watching old movies.
                His movies are famous for their spooky and unique vibe, which always has the 3 main roles:
                the good, the bad and the crazy.
